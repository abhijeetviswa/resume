A single-page, one-column resume for software developers. It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of
use and installation when trying to update the resume. The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands
are used to provide consistent formatting. The three main sections in the resume are education, experience, and projects.


### Build

The .tex file can be built to a pdf using `pdflatex`. This is the recommended method. Installing `texlive` should suffice
as far as packages are concerned.

### Attribution

The format itself is modified from [Sourabh Bajaj's resume template][1]. I cloned the repo and made changes to the code as
well as the data as per my requirements.
